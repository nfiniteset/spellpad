:description: \"\
      <p>A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you
  point and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement,
  it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with
  a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d6 points of fire damage to
  that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. A <i>flaming
  sphere</i> rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances
  it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would.</p>\
      <p>The sphere
  moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely
  stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out
  a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency
  and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling
  creatures or batter down large obstacles. A <i>flaming sphere</i> winks out if it
  exceeds the spell's range.</p>\
