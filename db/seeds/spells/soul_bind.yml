:focus: A black sapphire of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die possessed by
  the creature whose soul is to be bound. If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters
  when the binding is attempted. (While creatures have no concept of level or Hit
  Dice as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched.
  Remember that this value can change over time as creatures gain more Hit Dice.)
