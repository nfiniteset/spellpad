:material_components: Before the actual casting of trap the soul, you must procure
  a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die possessed by the creature to
  be trapped. If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is
  attempted. (While creatures have no concept of level or Hit Dice as such, the value
  of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value
  can change over time as creatures gain more Hit Dice.)
